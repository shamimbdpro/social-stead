How do I start a Facebook Fan Page marketing campaign?</p><ol style="text-align: justify;"><li class="font_8">Find and select the marketing package you want.</li><li class="font_8">Fill out any info required. This is usually just a link to the Fan Page you want to promote.</li><li class="font_8">Click the “Buy Now” button.</li></ol><p class="font_8" style="text-align: justify;">Make a payment via PayPal. If you don’t have an active PayPal account, you can pay with a credit card through PayPal without signing up for an account. After you have successfully paid in full, you will receive an email sent to your paypal email you used to place the order. The email will also contain more information about your order.</p><p class="font_8" style="text-align: justify;">What are the real benefits one might see after they order from <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>"><?php echo base_url(); ?></a>?<br /> For example, if you have only 32 Facebook fan page likes, you will not seem very popular to the next person that lands on your page. This will result in low trust and low sales, but the benefits don’t stop there: if you have very few likes, your fan page will also have a hard time ranking in search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, and even Facebook’s search itself. This means very few people will be able to find your fan page at all, let alone know whether or not it has a lot of likes.</p><p class="font_8" style="text-align: justify;">This goes for all social media marketing services, not just Facebook likes. Your customers want to see popularity. They want to know that they are not the only one buying your product. If they see that 5,000 people like what you do, it’s probably safe to say they are going to trust your company and want to learn more.</p><p class="font_8" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="wixGuard">​</span>Can I order multiple marketing packages?<br /> Absolutely! We encourage you to order other services if you want the maximum exposure. We recommend promoting your Facebook photos and your company website as well with Facebook likes. Don’t forget Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram as they are getting just as big as the other social networks.</p></div></div></article></div></div></div></div></div
